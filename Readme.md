## Work

To add an item to the Work page (`work.md`) start with the title of the project as such:

```
### Title of Project
```

This will put a bunch of empty space before this title, after whatever the last project was and will make the title Big. _Technical Note:_ The 3 # signs will be converted to an &lt;h3&gt; symbol.

If you want, follow it up with:

```
#### some sort of date or other subtitle
```

The 4 # will be rendered smaller and in italics, perfect for a subtitle or date or venue or whatever.
